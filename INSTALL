MDTK - Molecular Dynamics Toolkit
============================

Installation Instructions
=========================

MDTK uses CMake for its build and installation procedure.

To compile MDTK you will need 
  * C++-compiler (GNU C++ version 3.4.5 or above is fine)
  * CMake version 2.4.5 or above

Also you need development files of
  * GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
  * zlib library
  * Fast Light Toolkit (FLTK) version 1.1.x (FLTK 1.3.x may also work,
    but 1.1.x is recommended)
  * The OpenGL Utility Library (GLU), implementation from Mesa 3D
    works fine


After unpacking the distribution tarball, cd to mdtk-x.y.z directory.
The Makefiles can be prepared using the command,

  cmake .

The dot is required. It specifies where the source files are located.
You can then build MDTK by typing,

  make

and install it by typing,

  make install

The default installation directory prefix is CMake's default which is
usually /usr/local. Installing in this directory will require root
privileges on most systems (use "su" or "sudo").

The installation directory can be changed with the
-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option to cmake.
For example:

  cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt .
  make
  make install

or

  cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/my_apps .
  make
  make install


To perform automatic build and installion you can try one of the
following scripts:

  ./configure-build-install-default.sh
  ./configure-build-install-heavy-optimize.sh
  ./configure-build-install-non-default-gcc.sh
  ./configure-build-install-icc.sh
  ./configure-build-install-icc-heavy-optimize.sh

They perform out-of-source build of MDTK inside corresponding _build-*
directories using specific customizations of the build process (take a
look inside the scripts for details).


Hints for Microsoft Windows
===========================

MDTK compiles with MinGW/MSYS, and should compile with GNU C++ under
Cygwin on Microsoft Windows (but do not forget to install all
dependencies and libraries at first).

For standard MinGW/MSYS installation type,
  cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" .
  make

MDTK may also compile using Microsoft Visual C++. Project files can
be generated using appropriate -G cmake option. For example:

  cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" .


Testing the installation
===========================

To test the installation, cd to any directory (preferably empty - as it
will be populated with a lot of files) and run the command,

  mdC2H6 > simulation.log

It performs molecular dynamics simulation of the ethane molecule.
Current directory will be populated with some output files describing
MD trajectory. Detailed log of the simulation is redirected to the log
file.

Then visualize MD trajectory by running the command,

  mdtrajview -a

Option -a instructs to start animation immediately.
Now you should see two windows - one with animation and one with a lot
of controls.

If the directory with MDTK binaries is not in your $PATH, you can try
to run the example directly like this:
  1) cd to directory with mdC2H6 binary (e.g.,./examples/C2H6/)
  2) ./mdC2H6 > simulation.log
  3) ../../applications/mdtrajview/mdtrajview -a
