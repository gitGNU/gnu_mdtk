Original cluster configurations were obtained using mdbuilder. For
example:

        mdbuilder --prepare-clusters --cluster-size 39

The configurations can be found in the 'original' subdirectories.

Then clusters were rotated using mdtrajview GUI to unify their orientation
taking into account their symmetry. The configurations can be found in the
'rotated' subdirectories.
